## Log

### R1D1, August 24th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started a React project.

The project's requirements are:
- Development focuses on a single page application (SPA) called Interview Scheduler, built using React.
- Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.
- The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format.
- Jest tests are used through the development of the project.
- Interviews can be booked between Monday and Friday.
- A user can switch between weekdays.
- A user can book an interview in an empty appointment slot.
- Interviews are booked by typing in a student name and clicking on an interviewer from a list of available interviewers.
- A user can cancel an existing interview.
- A user can edit the details of an existing interview.
- The list of days informs the user how many slots are available for each day.
- The expected day updates the number of spots available when an interview is booked or canceled.
- A user is presented with a confirmation when they attempt to cancel an interview.
- A user is shown an error if an interview cannot be saved or deleted.
- A user is shown a status indicator while asynchronous operations are in progress.
- When the user presses the close button of the error they are returned to the Form or Show view (skipping Status and Confirm).
- The application makes API requests to load and persist data. We do not lose data after a browser refresh.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I touched a Front End project, and this is using the most recent updates to React, so I'm excited

### R1D2, August 25th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with making some of the components with Storybook. I'm having troubles getting the styling with classNames.

**Thoughts:** I'm a little distracted today, but managed to put in a good hour and a half.
